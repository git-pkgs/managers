       Install the gems specified in your Gemfile(5). If this is the first
       time you run bundle install (and a GGeemmffiillee..lloocckk does not exist),
       Bundler will fetch all remote sources, resolve dependencies and install
       all needed gems.

       If a GGeemmffiillee..lloocckk does exist, and you have not updated your Gemfile(5),
       Bundler will fetch all remote sources, but use the dependencies
       specified in the GGeemmffiillee..lloocckk instead of resolving dependencies.

       If a GGeemmffiillee..lloocckk does exist, and you have updated your Gemfile(5),
       Bundler will use the dependencies in the GGeemmffiillee..lloocckk for all gems that
       you did not update, but will re-resolve the dependencies of gems that
       you did update. You can find more information about this update process
       below under _C_O_N_S_E_R_V_A_T_I_V_E _U_P_D_A_T_I_N_G.

       ----ffoorrccee, ----rreeddoowwnnllooaadd
              Force reinstalling every gem, even if already installed.

       ----ffuullll--iinnddeexx
              Bundler will not call Rubygems' API endpoint (default) but
              download and cache a (currently big) index file of all gems.
              Performance can be improved for large bundles that seldom change
              by enabling this option.

       ----ggeemmffiillee==GGEEMMFFIILLEE
              The location of the Gemfile(5) which Bundler should use. This
              defaults to a Gemfile(5) in the current working directory. In
              general, Bundler will assume that the location of the Gemfile(5)
              is also the project's root and will try to find GGeemmffiillee..lloocckk and
              vveennddoorr//ccaacchhee relative to this location.

       ----jjoobbss==<<nnuummbbeerr>>, --jj==<<nnuummbbeerr>>
              The maximum number of parallel download and install jobs. The
              default is the number of available processors.

       ----llooccaall
              Do not attempt to connect to rruubbyyggeemmss..oorrgg. Instead, Bundler will
              use the gems already present in Rubygems' cache or in
              vveennddoorr//ccaacchhee. Note that if an appropriate platform-specific gem
              exists on rruubbyyggeemmss..oorrgg it will not be found.

       ----lloocckkffiillee==LLOOCCKKFFIILLEE
              The location of the lockfile which Bundler should use. This
              defaults to the Gemfile location with ..lloocckk appended.

       ----pprreeffeerr--llooccaall
              Force using locally installed gems, or gems already present in
              Rubygems' cache or in vveennddoorr//ccaacchhee, when resolving, even if
              newer versions are available remotely. Only attempt to connect
              to rruubbyyggeemmss..oorrgg for gems that are not present locally.

       ----nnoo--ccaacchhee
              Do not update the cache in vveennddoorr//ccaacchhee with the newly bundled
              gems. This does not remove any gems in the cache but keeps the
              newly bundled gems from being cached during the install.

       ----nnoo--lloocckk
              Do not create a lockfile. Useful if you want to install
              dependencies but not lock versions of gems. Recommended for
              library development, and other situations where the code is
              expected to work with a range of dependency versions.

              This has the same effect as using lloocckkffiillee ffaallssee in the Gemfile.
              See gemfile(5) for more information.

       ----qquuiieett
              Do not print progress information to the standard output.

       ----rreettrryy==[[<<nnuummbbeerr>>]]
              Retry failed network or git requests for _n_u_m_b_e_r times.

       ----ssttaannddaalloonnee[[==<<lliisstt>>]]
              Makes a bundle that can work without depending on Rubygems or
              Bundler at runtime. A space separated list of groups to install
              can be specified. Bundler creates a directory named bbuunnddllee and
              installs the bundle there. It also generates a
              bbuunnddllee//bbuunnddlleerr//sseettuupp..rrbb file to replace Bundler's own setup in
              the manner required.

DDEEPPLLOOYYMMEENNTT MMOODDEE
       Bundler's defaults are optimized for development. To switch to defaults
       optimized for deployment and for CI, use the ddeeppllooyymmeenntt setting. Do not
       activate deployment mode on development machines, as it will cause an
       error when the Gemfile(5) is modified.

       1.  A GGeemmffiillee..lloocckk is required.

           To ensure that the same versions of the gems you developed with and
           tested with are also used in deployments, a GGeemmffiillee..lloocckk is
           required.

           This is mainly to ensure that you remember to check your
           GGeemmffiillee..lloocckk into version control.

       2.  The GGeemmffiillee..lloocckk must be up to date

           In development, you can modify your Gemfile(5) and re-run bbuunnddllee
           iinnssttaallll to _c_o_n_s_e_r_v_a_t_i_v_e_l_y _u_p_d_a_t_e your GGeemmffiillee..lloocckk snapshot.

           In deployment, your GGeemmffiillee..lloocckk should be up-to-date with changes
           made in your Gemfile(5).

       3.  Gems are installed to vveennddoorr//bbuunnddllee not your default system
           location

           In development, it's convenient to share the gems used in your
           application with other applications and other scripts that run on
           the system.

           In deployment, isolation is a more important default. In addition,
           the user deploying the application may not have permission to
           install gems to the system, or the web server may not have
           permission to read them.

           As a result, when ddeeppllooyymmeenntt is configured, bbuunnddllee iinnssttaallll installs
           gems to the vveennddoorr//bbuunnddllee directory in the application. This may be
           overridden using the ppaatthh setting.




IINNSSTTAALLLLIINNGG GGRROOUUPPSS
       By default, bbuunnddllee iinnssttaallll will install all gems in all groups in your
       Gemfile(5), except those declared for a different platform.

       However, you can explicitly tell Bundler to skip installing certain
       groups with the wwiitthhoouutt setting. This setting takes a space-separated
       list of groups.

       While the wwiitthhoouutt setting will skip _i_n_s_t_a_l_l_i_n_g the gems in the
       specified groups, bbuunnddllee iinnssttaallll will still _d_o_w_n_l_o_a_d those gems and use
       them to resolve the dependencies of every gem in your Gemfile(5).

       This is so that installing a different set of groups on another machine
       (such as a production server) will not change the gems and versions
       that you have already developed and tested against.

       eennvviirroonnmmeennttss..

       For a simple illustration, consider the following Gemfile(5):


           source 'https://rubygems.org'

           gem 'sinatra'

           group :production do
             gem 'rack-perftools-profiler'
           end




       In this case, ssiinnaattrraa depends on any version of Rack (>>== 11..00), while
       rraacckk--ppeerrffttoooollss--pprrooffiilleerr depends on 1.x (~~>> 11..00).

       When you configure bbuunnddllee ccoonnffiigg wwiitthhoouutt pprroodduuccttiioonn in development, we
       look at the dependencies of rraacckk--ppeerrffttoooollss--pprrooffiilleerr as well. That way,
       you do not spend all your time developing against Rack 2.0, using new
       APIs unavailable in Rack 1.x, only to have Bundler switch to Rack 1.2
       when the pprroodduuccttiioonn group _i_s used.

       This should not cause any problems in practice, because we do not
       attempt to iinnssttaallll the gems in the excluded groups, and only evaluate
       as part of the dependency resolution process.

       This also means that you cannot include different versions of the same
       gem in different groups, because doing so would result in different
       sets of dependencies used in development and production. Because of the
       vagaries of the dependency resolution process, this usually affects
       more than the gems you list in your Gemfile(5), and can (surprisingly)
       radically change the gems you are using.

TTHHEE GGEEMMFFIILLEE..LLOOCCKK
       When you run bbuunnddllee iinnssttaallll, Bundler will persist the full names and
       versions of all gems that you used (including dependencies of the gems
       specified in the Gemfile(5)) into a file called GGeemmffiillee..lloocckk.

       Bundler uses this file in all subsequent calls to bbuunnddllee iinnssttaallll, which
       guarantees that you always use the same exact code, even as your
       application moves across machines.

       Because of the way dependency resolution works, even a seemingly small
       change (for instance, an update to a point-release of a dependency of a
       gem in your Gemfile(5)) can result in radically different gems being
       needed to satisfy all dependencies.

       As a result, you SSHHOOUULLDD check your GGeemmffiillee..lloocckk into version control,
       in both applications and gems. If you do not, every machine that checks
       out your repository (including your production server) will resolve all
       dependencies again, which will result in different versions of
       third-party code being used if aannyy of the gems in the Gemfile(5) or any
       of their dependencies have been updated.

       When Bundler first shipped, the GGeemmffiillee..lloocckk was included in the
       ..ggiittiiggnnoorree file included with generated gems. Over time, however, it
       became clear that this practice forces the pain of broken dependencies
       onto new contributors, while leaving existing contributors potentially
       unaware of the problem. Since bbuunnddllee iinnssttaallll is usually the first step
       towards a contribution, the pain of broken dependencies would
       discourage new contributors from contributing. As a result, we have
       revised our guidance for gem authors to now recommend checking in the
       lock for gems.

CCOONNSSEERRVVAATTIIVVEE UUPPDDAATTIINNGG
       When you make a change to the Gemfile(5) and then run bbuunnddllee iinnssttaallll,
       Bundler will update only the gems that you modified.

       In other words, if a gem that you ddiidd nnoott mmooddiiffyy worked before you
       called bbuunnddllee iinnssttaallll, it will continue to use the exact same versions
       of all dependencies as it used before the update.

       Let's take a look at an example. Here's your original Gemfile(5):


           source 'https://rubygems.org'

           gem 'actionpack', '2.3.8'
           gem 'activemerchant'




       In this case, both aaccttiioonnppaacckk and aaccttiivveemmeerrcchhaanntt depend on
       aaccttiivveessuuppppoorrtt. The aaccttiioonnppaacckk gem depends on aaccttiivveessuuppppoorrtt 22..33..88 and
       rraacckk ~~>> 11..11..00, while the aaccttiivveemmeerrcchhaanntt gem depends on aaccttiivveessuuppppoorrtt >>==
       22..33..22, bbrraaiinnttrreeee >>== 22..00..00, and bbuuiillddeerr >>== 22..00..00.

       When the dependencies are first resolved, Bundler will select
       aaccttiivveessuuppppoorrtt 22..33..88, which satisfies the requirements of both gems in
       your Gemfile(5).

       Next, you modify your Gemfile(5) to:


           source 'https://rubygems.org'

           gem 'actionpack', '3.0.0.rc'
           gem 'activemerchant'




       The aaccttiioonnppaacckk 33..00..00..rrcc gem has a number of new dependencies, and
       updates the aaccttiivveessuuppppoorrtt dependency to == 33..00..00..rrcc and the rraacckk
       dependency to ~~>> 11..22..11.

       When you run bbuunnddllee iinnssttaallll, Bundler notices that you changed the
       aaccttiioonnppaacckk gem, but not the aaccttiivveemmeerrcchhaanntt gem. It evaluates the gems
       currently being used to satisfy its requirements:

       aaccttiivveessuuppppoorrtt 22..33..88
              also used to satisfy a dependency in aaccttiivveemmeerrcchhaanntt, which is
              not being updated

       rraacckk ~~>> 11..11..00
              not currently being used to satisfy another dependency

       Because you did not explicitly ask to update aaccttiivveemmeerrcchhaanntt, you would
       not expect it to suddenly stop working after updating aaccttiioonnppaacckk.
       However, satisfying the new aaccttiivveessuuppppoorrtt 33..00..00..rrcc dependency of
       actionpack requires updating one of its dependencies.

       Even though aaccttiivveemmeerrcchhaanntt declares a very loose dependency that
       theoretically matches aaccttiivveessuuppppoorrtt 33..00..00..rrcc, Bundler treats gems in
       your Gemfile(5) that have not changed as an atomic unit together with
       their dependencies. In this case, the aaccttiivveemmeerrcchhaanntt dependency is
       treated as aaccttiivveemmeerrcchhaanntt 11..77..11 ++ aaccttiivveessuuppppoorrtt 22..33..88, so bbuunnddllee
       iinnssttaallll will report that it cannot update aaccttiioonnppaacckk.

       To explicitly update aaccttiioonnppaacckk, including its dependencies which other
       gems in the Gemfile(5) still depend on, run bbuunnddllee uuppddaattee aaccttiioonnppaacckk
       (see bbuunnddllee uuppddaattee((11))).

       SSuummmmaarryy: In general, after making a change to the Gemfile(5) , you
       should first try to run bbuunnddllee iinnssttaallll, which will guarantee that no
       other gem in the Gemfile(5) is impacted by the change. If that does not
       work, run bundle update(1) _b_u_n_d_l_e_-_u_p_d_a_t_e_._1_._h_t_m_l.
