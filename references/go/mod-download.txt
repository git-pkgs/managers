usage: go mod download [-x] [-json] [-reuse=old.json] [modules]

Download downloads the named modules, which can be module patterns selecting
dependencies of the main module or module queries of the form path@version.

With no arguments, download applies to the modules needed to build and test
the packages in the main module: the modules explicitly required by the main
module if it is at 'go 1.17' or higher, or all transitively-required modules
if at 'go 1.16' or lower.

The go command will automatically download modules as needed during ordinary
execution. The "go mod download" command is useful mainly for pre-filling
the local cache or to compute the answers for a Go module proxy.

By default, download writes nothing to standard output. It may print progress
messages and errors to standard error.

The -json flag causes download to print a sequence of JSON objects
to standard output, describing each downloaded module (or failure),
corresponding to this Go struct:

    type Module struct {
        Path     string // module path
        Query    string // version query corresponding to this version
        Version  string // module version
        Error    string // error loading module
        Info     string // absolute path to cached .info file
        GoMod    string // absolute path to cached .mod file
        Zip      string // absolute path to cached .zip file
        Dir      string // absolute path to cached source root directory
        Sum      string // checksum for path, version (as in go.sum)
        GoModSum string // checksum for go.mod (as in go.sum)
        Origin   any    // provenance of module
        Reuse    bool   // reuse of old module info is safe
    }

The -reuse flag accepts the name of file containing the JSON output of a
previous 'go mod download -json' invocation. The go command may use this
file to determine that a module is unchanged since the previous invocation
and avoid redownloading it. Modules that are not redownloaded will be marked
in the new output by setting the Reuse field to true. Normally the module
cache provides this kind of reuse automatically; the -reuse flag can be
useful on systems that do not preserve the module cache.

The -x flag causes download to print the commands download executes.
