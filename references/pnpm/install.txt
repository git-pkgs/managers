Version 8.14.0
Usage: pnpm install [options]

Alias: i

Installs all dependencies of the project in the current working directory. When executed inside a workspace, installs all dependencies of all projects.

Options:
      --[no-]color                      Controls colors in the output. By
                                        default, output is always colored when
                                        it goes directly to a terminal
      --[no-]frozen-lockfile            Don't generate a lockfile and fail if an
                                        update is needed. This setting is on by
                                        default in CI environments, so use
                                        --no-frozen-lockfile if you need to
                                        disable it for some reason
      --[no-]verify-store-integrity     If false, doesn't check whether packages
                                        in the store were mutated
      --aggregate-output                Aggregate output from child processes
                                        that are run in parallel, and only print
                                        output when child process is finished.
                                        It makes reading large logs after
                                        running `pnpm recursive` with
                                        `--parallel` or with
                                        `--workspace-concurrency` much easier
                                        (especially on CI). Only
                                        `--reporter=append-only` is supported.
      --child-concurrency <number>      Controls the number of child processes
                                        run parallelly to build node modules
  -D, --dev                             Only `devDependencies` are installed
                                        regardless of the `NODE_ENV`
  -C, --dir <dir>                       Change to directory <dir> (default:
                                        /Users/andrew/code/git-pkgs/managers/
                                        references/pnpm)
      --fix-lockfile                    Fix broken lockfile entries
                                        automatically
      --force                           Force reinstall dependencies: refetch
                                        packages modified in store, recreate a
                                        lockfile and/or modules directory
                                        created by a non-compatible version of
                                        pnpm. Install all optionalDependencies
                                        even they don't satisfy the current
                                        environment(cpu, os, arch)
      --global-dir                      Specify a custom directory to store
                                        global packages
  -h, --help                            Output usage information
      --hoist-pattern <pattern>         Hoist all dependencies matching the
                                        pattern to
                                        `node_modules/.pnpm/node_modules`. The
                                        default pattern is * and matches
                                        everything. Hoisted packages can be
                                        required by any dependencies, so it is
                                        an emulation of a flat node_modules
      --ignore-pnpmfile                 Disable pnpm hooks defined in
                                        .pnpmfile.cjs
      --ignore-scripts                  Don't run lifecycle scripts
      --lockfile-dir <dir>              The directory in which the
                                        pnpm-lock.yaml of the package will be
                                        created. Several projects may share a
                                        single lockfile.
      --lockfile-only                   Dependencies are not downloaded. Only
                                        `pnpm-lock.yaml` is updated
      --loglevel <level>                What level of logs to report. Any logs
                                        at or higher than the given level will
                                        be shown. Levels (lowest to highest):
                                        debug, info, warn, error. Or use
                                        "--silent" to turn off all logging.
      --merge-git-branch-lockfiles      Merge lockfiles were generated on git
                                        branch
      --modules-dir <dir>               The directory in which dependencies will
                                        be installed (instead of node_modules)
      --network-concurrency <number>    Maximum number of concurrent network
                                        requests
      --no-hoist                        Dependencies inside the modules
                                        directory will have access only to their
                                        listed dependencies
      --no-lockfile                     Don't read or generate a

      --no-optional                     `optionalDependencies` are not installed
      --offline                         Trigger an error if any required
                                        dependencies are not available in local
                                        store
      --package-import-method auto      Clones/hardlinks or copies packages. The
                                        selected method depends from the file
                                        system
      --package-import-method clone     Clone (aka copy-on-write) packages from
                                        the store
      --package-import-method copy      Copy packages from the store
      --package-import-method hardlink  Hardlink packages from the store
      --prefer-frozen-lockfile          If the available `pnpm-lock.yaml`
                                        satisfies the `package.json` then
                                        perform a headless installation
      --prefer-offline                  Skip staleness checks for cached data,
                                        but request missing data from the server
  -P, --prod                            Packages in `devDependencies` won't be
                                        installed
      --public-hoist-pattern <pattern>  Hoist all dependencies matching the
                                        pattern to the root of the modules
                                        directory
  -r, --recursive                       Run installation recursively in every
                                        package found in subdirectories. For
                                        options that may be used with `-r`, see
                                        "pnpm help recursive"
      --resolution-only                 Re-runs resolution: useful for printing
                                        out peer dependency issues
      --shamefully-hoist                All the subdeps will be hoisted into the
                                        root node_modules. Your code will have
                                        access to them
      --side-effects-cache              Use or cache the results of
                                        (pre/post)install hooks
      --side-effects-cache-readonly     Only use the side effects cache if
                                        present, do not create it for new
                                        packages
      --store-dir <dir>                 The directory in which all the packages
                                        are saved on the disk
      --stream                          Stream output from child processes
                                        immediately, prefixed with the
                                        originating package directory. This
                                        allows output from different packages to
                                        be interleaved.
      --strict-peer-dependencies        Fail on missing or invalid peer
                                        dependencies
      --use-running-store-server        Only allows installation with a store
                                        server. If no store server is running,
                                        installation will fail
      --use-stderr                      Divert all output to stderr
      --use-store-server                Starts a store server in the background.
                                        The store server will keep running after
                                        installation is done. To stop the store
                                        server, run `pnpm server stop`
      --virtual-store-dir <dir>         The directory with links to the store
                                        (default is node_modules/.pnpm). All
                                        direct and indirect dependencies of the
                                        project are linked into this directory
  -w, --workspace-root                  Run the command on the root workspace
                                        project

Output:
      --reporter append-only       The output is always appended to the end. No
                                   cursor manipulations are performed
      --reporter default           The default reporter when the stdout is TTY
      --reporter ndjson            The most verbose reporter. Prints all logs in
                                   ndjson format
  -s, --silent, --reporter silent  No output is logged to the console, except
                                   fatal errors

Filtering options (run the command only on packages that satisfy at least one of the selectors):
      --changed-files-ignore-pattern <pattern>  Defines files to ignore when
                                                filtering for changed projects
                                                since the specified
                                                commit/branch. Usage example:
                                                pnpm
                                                --filter="...[origin/master]"
                                                --changed-files-ignore-
                                                pattern="**/README.md" build
      --fail-if-no-match                        If no projects are matched by
                                                the command, exit with exit code
                                                1 (fail)
      --filter !<selector>                      If a selector starts with ! (or
                                                \! in zsh), it means the
                                                packages matching the selector
                                                must be excluded. E.g., "pnpm
                                                --filter !foo" selects all
                                                packages except "foo"
      --filter .                                Includes all packages that are
                                                under the current working
                                                directory
      --filter ...^<pattern>                    Includes only the direct and
                                                indirect dependents of the
                                                matched packages without
                                                including the matched packages
                                                themselves. ^ must be doubled at
                                                the Windows Command Prompt.
                                                E.g.: ...^foo (...^^foo in
                                                Command Prompt)
      --filter ...<pattern>                     Includes all direct and indirect
                                                dependents of the matched
                                                packages. E.g.: ...foo,
                                                "...@bar/*"
      --filter ./<dir>                          Includes all packages that are
                                                inside a given subdirectory.
                                                E.g.: ./components
      --filter "[<since>]"                      Includes all packages changed
                                                since the specified
                                                commit/branch. E.g.: "[master]",
                                                "[HEAD~2]". It may be used
                                                together with "...". So, for
                                                instance, "...[HEAD~1]" selects
                                                all packages changed in the last
                                                commit and their dependents
      --filter {<dir>}                          Includes all projects that are

      --filter <pattern>                        Restricts the scope to package
                                                names matching the given
                                                pattern. E.g.: foo, "@bar/*"
      --filter <pattern>...                     Includes all direct and indirect
                                                dependencies of the matched
                                                packages. E.g.: foo...
      --filter <pattern>^...                    Includes only the direct and
                                                indirect dependencies of the
                                                matched packages without
                                                including the matched packages
                                                themselves. ^ must be doubled at

                                                E.g.: foo^... (foo^^... in

      --filter-prod <pattern>                   Restricts the scope to package
                                                names matching the given pattern
                                                similar to --filter, but it
                                                ignores devDependencies when
                                                searching for dependencies and
                                                dependents.
      --test-pattern <pattern>                  Defines files related to tests.
                                                Useful with the changed since
                                                filter. When selecting only
                                                changed packages and their
                                                dependent packages, the
                                                dependent packages will be
                                                ignored in case a package has
                                                changes only in tests. Usage
                                                example: pnpm
                                                --filter="...[origin/master]"
                                                --test-pattern="test/*" test
