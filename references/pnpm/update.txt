Version 8.14.0
Usage: pnpm update [-g] [<pkg>...]

Aliases: up, upgrade

Updates packages to their latest version based on the specified range. You can use "*" in package name to update all packages with the same pattern.

Options:
      --[no-]color         Controls colors in the output. By default, output is
                           always colored when it goes directly to a terminal
      --aggregate-output   Aggregate output from child processes that are run in
                           parallel, and only print output when child process is
                           finished. It makes reading large logs after running
                           `pnpm recursive` with `--parallel` or with
                           `--workspace-concurrency` much easier (especially on
                           CI). Only `--reporter=append-only` is supported.
      --depth <number>     How deep should levels of dependencies be inspected.
                           Infinity is default. 0 would mean top-level
                           dependencies only
  -D, --dev                Update packages only in "devDependencies"
  -C, --dir <dir>          Change to directory <dir> (default:
                           /Users/andrew/code/git-pkgs/managers/references/pnpm)
  -g, --global             Update globally installed packages
      --global-dir         Specify a custom directory to store global packages
  -h, --help               Output usage information
  -i, --interactive        Show outdated dependencies and select which ones to
                           update
  -L, --latest             Ignore version ranges in package.json
      --loglevel <level>   What level of logs to report. Any logs at or higher
                           than the given level will be shown. Levels (lowest to
                           highest): debug, info, warn, error. Or use "--silent"
                           to turn off all logging.
      --no-optional        Don't update packages in "optionalDependencies"
  -P, --prod               Update packages only in "dependencies" and
                           "optionalDependencies"
  -r, --recursive          Update in every package found in subdirectories or
                           every workspace package, when executed inside a
                           workspace. For options that may be used with `-r`,
                           see "pnpm help recursive"
      --stream             Stream output from child processes immediately,
                           prefixed with the originating package directory. This
                           allows output from different packages to be
                           interleaved.
      --use-stderr         Divert all output to stderr
      --workspace          Tries to link all packages from the workspace.
                           Versions are updated to match the versions of
                           packages inside the workspace. If specific packages
                           are updated, the command will fail if any of the
                           updated dependencies is not found inside the
                           workspace
  -w, --workspace-root     Run the command on the root workspace project

Filtering options (run the command only on packages that satisfy at least one of the selectors):
      --changed-files-ignore-pattern <pattern>  Defines files to ignore when
                                                filtering for changed projects
                                                since the specified
                                                commit/branch. Usage example:
                                                pnpm
                                                --filter="...[origin/master]"
                                                --changed-files-ignore-
                                                pattern="**/README.md" build
      --fail-if-no-match                        If no projects are matched by
                                                the command, exit with exit code
                                                1 (fail)
      --filter !<selector>                      If a selector starts with ! (or
                                                \! in zsh), it means the
                                                packages matching the selector
                                                must be excluded. E.g., "pnpm
                                                --filter !foo" selects all
                                                packages except "foo"
      --filter .                                Includes all packages that are
                                                under the current working
                                                directory
      --filter ...^<pattern>                    Includes only the direct and
                                                indirect dependents of the
                                                matched packages without
                                                including the matched packages
                                                themselves. ^ must be doubled at
                                                the Windows Command Prompt.
                                                E.g.: ...^foo (...^^foo in
                                                Command Prompt)
      --filter ...<pattern>                     Includes all direct and indirect
                                                dependents of the matched
                                                packages. E.g.: ...foo,
                                                "...@bar/*"
      --filter ./<dir>                          Includes all packages that are
                                                inside a given subdirectory.
                                                E.g.: ./components
      --filter "[<since>]"                      Includes all packages changed
                                                since the specified
                                                commit/branch. E.g.: "[master]",
                                                "[HEAD~2]". It may be used
                                                together with "...". So, for
                                                instance, "...[HEAD~1]" selects
                                                all packages changed in the last
                                                commit and their dependents
      --filter {<dir>}                          Includes all projects that are
                                                under the specified directory.
                                                It may be used with "..." to
                                                select dependents/dependencies
                                                as well. It also may be combined
                                                with "[<since>]". For instance,
                                                all changed projects inside a
                                                directory:
                                                "{packages}[origin/master]"
      --filter <pattern>                        Restricts the scope to package
                                                names matching the given
                                                pattern. E.g.: foo, "@bar/*"
      --filter <pattern>...                     Includes all direct and indirect
                                                dependencies of the matched
                                                packages. E.g.: foo...
      --filter <pattern>^...                    Includes only the direct and
                                                indirect dependencies of the
                                                matched packages without
                                                including the matched packages
                                                themselves. ^ must be doubled at
                                                the Windows Command Prompt.
                                                E.g.: foo^... (foo^^... in
                                                Command Prompt)
      --filter-prod <pattern>                   Restricts the scope to package
                                                names matching the given pattern
                                                similar to --filter, but it
                                                ignores devDependencies when
                                                searching for dependencies and
                                                dependents.
      --test-pattern <pattern>                  Defines files related to tests.
                                                Useful with the changed since
                                                filter. When selecting only
                                                changed packages and their
                                                dependent packages, the
                                                dependent packages will be
                                                ignored in case a package has
                                                changes only in tests. Usage
                                                example: pnpm
                                                --filter="...[origin/master]"
                                                --test-pattern="test/*" test
